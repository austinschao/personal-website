            Hello! My name is Austin Chao and I am from Oakland, CA.
            I am currently a student at Rithm School. I have been studying 
            HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the last several months in 
            preparation for their 16 week program. Becoming a software
            engineer will be my second career, as I previously worked 
            for a law enforcement agency for about eight years, five of
            those being a police officer. What drew me to law
            enforcement was the ability to help others in need which is 
            something I am passionate about and I will continue to do in
            the tech industry. 
        </p>
